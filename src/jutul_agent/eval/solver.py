"""Run one full jutul-agent session per Inspect sample.

The solver builds the same stack a real session uses (workspace, Julia
kernel, :class:`Session`, ``build_agent``, ``TurnRunner``) inside Inspect's
``agent_bridge``. The bridge intercepts the model client, so the eval's
``--model`` decides which provider actually answers while the agent's tools,
skills, prompt, and trace run unchanged. Scorers grade through the sample
store, which records where the session's workspace and trace database ended
up (see :data:`STORE_WORKSPACE`, :data:`STORE_TRACE_DB`).

Sample metadata understood by the solver:

- ``fixtures``: mapping of workspace-relative path -> file content, written
  before the turn starts.
- ``needs_env``: instantiate the simulator's Julia environment in the
  workspace first (slow on a cold depot; off by default).
- ``needs_display``: start a managed virtual display so GLMakie plotting
  works headless.

    - Other providers use the Anthropic client, whose plain ``messages.create``

    Instantiating a simulator env from scratch takes minutes; one prepared
    copy lives under the jutul-agent home (``eval-envs/<sim>``) and each
    sample starts from a copy of it. Copying preserves mtimes, so the
    precompile marker stays current and the per-sample env prep is a cheap
    reconcile instead of a full instantiate.

    Envs carry no version pins, so a cached copy freezes whatever upstream
    served when it was built and would silently grade against old versions
    after a new release. On its first use in a run, a cached env is therefore
    re-resolved against the registry (``update_env``); if that fails, the run
    fails rather than grade a misaligned environment.

    The golden is then brought fully current once with ``prepare_workspace_env``
    (the normal launch reconcile): the in-env JutulAgent runtime is refreshed and
    marked, and the env precompiled. Without this, a golden whose warm-source
    marker is stale (e.g. cached before the runtime changed) makes *every*
    per-sample copy re-copy the runtime and re-bake the env — turning a one-time
    cost into a per-sample one. Aligning the golden lets each copy's reconcile be
    the intended cheap no-op.
